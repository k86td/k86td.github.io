*I'm no smart person, I'm just writing to change my mind.*

Human emotions are an extremely complex case. Where one would feel happiness, another would feel hate. The associations between an action and an emotion is hard to predict. The fragility of the human mind to external stimulus makes it more likely to differ from its original trajectory. Some might be able to sense the divergence and act accordingly to control their emotions. These individuals might have a greater deal of self-control. But certain emotions might appear random for certain people.

Negative emotions will always be more signifiant than the positive ones.
